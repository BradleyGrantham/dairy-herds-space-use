# Space use of dairy herds

This was my final year project for my BSc Physics degree
at the University of Bath

It is a collection of R scripts that do data analysis of
spatial data that has been collected on the positions of 
dairy cows in fields across the UK.

The data was collected from satellite images from Google maps

## Usage

There's no real usage with this. It's just a collection of R 
scripts that can be used to analyse some geospatial data of
dairy herds

I've added the entire repo at the same time because initially 
it wasn't version controlled. Only adding for future reference
